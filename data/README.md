# DATA

For simplicity, we included most of the data (when suitable and not too large) directly in the repository to have everything in one place.

# Difference Graphs

We placed all model difference graphs in `diffgraphs_new.zip`. 
These include the different projects and their commit history.
We gained these graphs with the help of EMFCompare. 

# Embeddings

Unfortunately, the files of node embeddings are too large to be included all.  
However, they can easily be generated using `preprocessing_add_node_embeddings.py` in experiments/crosscutting_changes.
For quick testing, we included a very, very small subset in the folder. This subset is **not representative**, but gives a basic idea of the format etc.

# Network

# Evaluation

The final output of our baselines and our approach 'NextFocus' (i.e., the output of the "Testing" stage),  
which can be passed into the scripts under "Final statistics and eval", is provided in `output_ONLYONE4.zip`.
